# SPL-Assignment1
C++ "Cybersecurity" Simulation

# About
This assignment was made as part of the SPL (Systems Programming Course) at BGU university. <br>
Assignment Instructions: http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~spl161/wiki.files/spl161_hw1v1.2.pdf

# Main Objective
Correct memory management handling in C++. 
This assignment simulates a 'cyber-security' attack. Firstly reading xml configuration files <br>
and setting up a network of 'computers'. After the building of the network the simulations <br>
iterates over the events xml file until termination time, executing events of the types:  <br>
• Clock-In events (Cyber expert started working) <br> 
• Hack events (A specific computer is hacked) <br>
• Cleaning events (Cyber expert succeded in removing a worm) <br>
• Infection events (A worm has infected a certain computer) <br>
• Termination events <br>
