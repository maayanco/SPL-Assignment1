Firstly reading xml configuration files and setting up a network of 'computers'.\r\nAfter the building of the network the simulations iterates over the events xml file until termination time, executing events of the types:\r\n• Clock-In events (Cyber expert started working)\r\n• Hack events (A specific computer is hacked)\r\n• Cleaning events (Cyber expert succeded in removing a worm)\r\n• Infection events (A worm has infected a certain computer)\r\n• Termination events ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
